Automated AIFMD Data Validation & Compliance Utility

This Python project is designed to streamline and automate critical data validation and compliance checks related to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). It provides a robust framework for processing standardized financial data, ensuring accuracy and adherence to regulatory requirements.

üí° Problem Solved
In the financial sector, particularly with alternative investment funds, ensuring data quality and regulatory compliance (like AIFMD) is paramount but often manual and error-prone. This project addresses the challenge of efficiently ingesting, standardizing, and validating complex financial data from common formats, minimizing human error and facilitating accurate reporting.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Functionality
Standardized Data Ingestion: Automates the parsing and loading of financial data from standardized Excel formats, handling common conventions across multiple worksheets.

Cohesive Data Models: Utilizes structured Python classes to represent complex financial instruments, fund information, and reporting entities, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

Comprehensive Data Validation: Implements a suite of checks to validate the quality and compliance of ingested data against predefined rules.

Robust Error Handling: Features custom error classes to systematically capture and store validation and quality issues, enabling clear reporting and efficient remediation.

Modularity & Reusability: Designed with a clear separation of concerns, promoting reusable components for various data processing and validation tasks.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
This project is built entirely in Python, showcasing advanced programming practices for data engineering:

Core Logic: The common package houses a central DataProcessor utility class. This class is responsible for parsing data from standardized Excel files and applying common data conventions across diverse worksheets.

Data Structure: Structured data models for aifmd_dataclasses (custom classes, not Python's dataclasses decorator) are used to organize and represent financial data in a cohesive and domain-specific manner.

Quality Assurance: The common package also defines custom error classes, which are leveraged throughout the data validation and quality steps to provide detailed and actionable error reporting.

### üéØ Domain Relevance
aifmd_checks demonstrates a strong understanding of:

Financial Data Engineering: Handling and processing complex financial datasets.

Regulatory Compliance (RegTech): Specifically, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD).

Data Quality Assurance: Implementing rigorous checks to ensure data accuracy and reliability in a high-stakes environment.
